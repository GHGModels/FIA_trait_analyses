<h2>Summary:</h2>
<p class="I1">This data set provides carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), 
potassium (K), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) concentrations in green and 
senesced leaves. Vegetation characteristics reported include species growth habit, leaf area, mass, and mass loss with senescence. The data were compiled from 86 selected studies in 31 countries, and 
resulted in approximately 1,000 data points for both green and senesced leaves from woody and non-woody vegetation as described in Vergutz et al (2012). 
The studies were conducted from 1970-2009. There are two comma-delimited data files with this data set.</p>

<h2>3. Data Application and Derivation:</h2>
<p class="I1">Mass data were used in the calculation of the mass loss correction factor (MLCF), which is the ratio of the dry mass of green leaves, 
to the dry mass of senesced leaves. The MLCF was calculated directly when both dry masses were available and estimated as 1-LML/100 when only the percentage of leaf mass loss (LML)
 was given (Vergutz et al., 2012). </p>

<p class="I1">Nutrient concentration data were applied in calculating nutrient resorption efficiencies. 
Using this global database of nutrient contents in green and senesced leaves, resorption efficiencies can be computed across plant types and climates, while accounting for mass loss during senescence. Investigators used the data to compare the relationship between mean nutrient resorption efficiency and climate variables (mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean annual precipitation (MAP)). The mean nutrient resorption efficiency for each nutrient for the data set as a whole and for each plant growth type and climate group were separately calculated using a
 regression analysis (Vergutz et al., 2012). </p>

<p class="I1">Vergutz et al., (2012),  analyzed 28 ecosystem and biogeochemical models and found wide variation in nutrient resorption efficiency values used in the models. Ecosystem models tend to neglect phosphorus dynamics and do not consider other nutrients, but these nutrient resorption parameters are important for the accuracy of such models. This study has highlighted specific limitations in current resorption parameterizations to help identify improvements for future biogeochemical
 and land surface models. </p>

<p class="I1">  See original source articles for quality assessment information.</p>


<a name="HAcqMatMethods"></a>
<h2>5. Data Acquisition Materials and Methods:</h2>
<p class="I1">Data were obtained from published studies that reported or 
provided sufficient information to calculate mean values of carbon and 
N, P, K, Ca, and Mg nutrient mass per unit dry mass in mature green and senesced leaves and reported nutrient content on
 a leaf-mass basis (Vergutz et al., 2012).
Using Web of Science and Google Scholar search engines, investigators identified studies on nutrient contents in green and senesced leaves 
with search terms such as “resorption,” nutrient reabsorption,” “nutrient use efficiency,” and “leaf mass loss.”</p>


<p class="I1">Data were compiled from 86 studies conducted in 31 countries and resulted in approximately 1,000 data points for both green and senesced leaves from woody and non-woody vegetation. The leaf data were collected from studies taking place from 1970-2009. The data came from major plant types including woody (lianas, shrubs, and trees) and non-woody species, grouped in six growth types: ferns, forbs, gramminoids, conifers, 
evergreen woody angiosperms, and deciduous woody angiosperms (Vergutz et al., 2012).</p>
 <p class="I1">Data were compiled on leaf nutrient concentrations from terrestrial plants in every continent except Antarctica, with the majority of the data from Europe and North America. Investigators noted that most of the data for senesced leaves came from newly fallen leaves, with the fewest data from litter-trap studies. Only unfertilized controls from fertilized systems, including annual crops, were included in the data set. Overall, 171 data points were available for carbon concentrations in leaves, with 948 available for nitrogen, 699 for phosphorus, 207
  for potassium, 150 for calcium, 115 for magnesium, and 191 for the leaf mass-loss calculations (Vergutz et al., 2012).</p>
 <p class="I1">Mean annual temperature (MAT) data was obtained for each site and ranged from -8° to 31.6°C, mean annual precipitation (MAP) for each site ranged from 125 to 550 mm/yr, and elevation across sites ranged from 0 to 3520 m above sea level. Based on climatic features, study locations were grouped according to Köppen Climate Classification which organized data into five climatic regions: topical/megathermal, dry, temperate/mesothermal, continental/microthermal,
  and polar (McKnight and Hess 2000, Kottek et al. 2006).</p>
